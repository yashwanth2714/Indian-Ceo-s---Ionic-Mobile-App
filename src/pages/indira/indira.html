            <b>Named the third most powerful woman in business by Fortune magazine last year, Ms Nooyi was, like Sundar Pichai, born in Chennai.
      <br><br>
      She was named CEO of PepsiCo in 2006, having joined the company in 1994.
      <br><br>
      The company she presides over is a food and drinks giant: some of the brands owned by PepsiCo include Starbucks, Muller, Frito-Lay and Tropicana. The company says 22 of its brands are each worth more than $1bn (Â£640m).
      <br><br>
      "In my case, I benefited because I grew up outside of the United States," Ms Nooyi said in an interview in March.
      <br><br>
      "I understand exactly how the world works, and I could see the world through the eyes of people from outside the United States."
