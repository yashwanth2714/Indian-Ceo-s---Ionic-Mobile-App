        <b>Satya Nadella, who hails from the Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Now is the current chief executive officer of Microsoft. He was appointed as CEO on 4 February 2014.<br><br>
  
  On his first day in the job, the father-of-three sent an email to all staff, calling it "a very humbling day for me".<br><br>
  
  "I am... defined by my curiosity and thirst for learning," he told staff. "I buy more books than I can finish. I sign up for more online courses than I can complete.<br><br>
  
  "I fundamentally believe that if you are not learning new things, you stop doing great and useful things."<br><br>
  Before becoming CEO, he was Executive Vice President of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group, responsible for building and running the company's computing platforms, developer tools and cloud computing services.<br>
