          ><b>After working for Nestle, then PepsiCo, Mr Banga - who is from Pune - took over as CEO of the credit card company in July 2010. He began his career with Nestle in 1981.
      <br><br>
      In a speech in April to his alma mater, the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), he outlined what he called the "grand plan" he had at the start of his career.
      <br><br>
      "Get with somebody good. Get with somebody global. Do something that interested me. That's it. So, don't stress if you haven't got a detailed plan for your life. Anyone can have a good idea or plan; what makes it great is execution."
      <br><br>
      He also outlined six main lessons for good leadership:
      <br><br>
      a sense of urgency<br>
      a sense of balance<br>
      the courage to take thoughtful risks<br>
      be competitively paranoid<br>
      develop a global view<br>
      do well and do good
